# -Induction-Motor-Driven-Water-Pump-Fed-by-Solar-Photovoltaic-Array-Using-Boost-Converter



The proposed system consists of an arrangement of solar panels, boost 
converter, three phase inverter and three phase motor. The boost 
converter is used to enhance the power from the PV array and get 
constant DC output. Then the output from the boost converter is given 
to the induction motor. The centrifugal pump is driven by three phase 
induction motors.
